# Heart Disease Predictor Application
Python application to serve as an exploration into machine learning. This application was done as part of a capstone project for WGU (Western Governors University) and serves as my senior project for completion of my Bachelor's Degree. Application features a GUI for users to input their symptoms and get a prediction of their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Application also provides advice for improving problematic symptoms. 

Application can be downloaded and used using the most recent release. This was a project for school, so the likelihood of this tool being updated in the future is minimal.

## AI Model (Random Forest)
The AI model used for generating predictions was a Random Forest. Model was trained on datasets from Kaggle which are included within the repository. Model used within the application was generated after tweaking parameters and choosing the one with the most accurate metrics with minimal false positives.
## GUI
Main application is written in Python and uses PyQt6 to generate the GUI. Designed using QtDesigner to speed up creation and styling of the GUI.
